# jenkins-docker-nodejs

Runs Jenkins agent in a docker container with different versions of NodeJS to easily build those projects you have in an ephemeral way instead of setting up individual jenkins executors.  This allows you to run several jobs at once with minimal resources in a much more controlled way.
